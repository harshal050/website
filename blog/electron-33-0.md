### Breaking Changes

#### Removed: macOS 10.15 support

macOS 10.15 (Catalina) is no longer supported by [Chromium](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/5734361).

Older versions of Electron will continue to run on Catalina, but macOS 11 (Big Sur)
or later will be required to run Electron v33.0.0 and higher.

#### Behavior Changed: Native modules now require C++20

Due to changes made upstream, both [V8](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/v8/v8/+/5587859) and [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/45427) now require C++20 as a minimum version. Developers using native node modules should build their modiles with `--std=c++20` rather than `--std=c++17`. Images using gcc9 or lower may need to update to gcc10 in order to compile. See [#43555](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/43555) for more details.

#### Behavior Changed: custom protocol URL handling on Windows

Due to changes made in Chromium to support [Non-Special Scheme URLs](http://bit.ly/url-non-special), custom protocol URLs that use Windows file paths will no longer work correctly with the deprecated `protocol.registerFileProtocol` and the `baseURLForDataURL` property on `BrowserWindow.loadURL`, `WebContents.loadURL`, and `<webview>.loadURL`. `protocol.handle` will also not work with these types of URLs but this is not a change since it has always worked that way.

```js
// No longer works
protocol.registerFileProtocol('other', () => {
  callback({ filePath: '/path/to/my/file' });
});

const mainWindow = new BrowserWindow();
mainWindow.loadURL(
  'data:text/html,<script src="loaded-from-dataurl.js"></script>',
  { baseURLForDataURL: 'other://C:\\myapp' }
);
mainWindow.loadURL('other://C:\\myapp\\index.html');

// Replace with
const path = require('node:path');
const nodeUrl = require('node:url');
protocol.handle(other, (req) => {
  const srcPath = 'C:\\myapp\\';
  const reqURL = new URL(req.url);
  return net.fetch(
    nodeUrl.pathToFileURL(path.join(srcPath, reqURL.pathname)).toString()
  );
});

mainWindow.loadURL(
  'data:text/html,<script src="loaded-from-dataurl.js"></script>',
  { baseURLForDataURL: 'other://' }
);
mainWindow.loadURL('other://index.html');
```

#### Behavior Changed: `webContents` property on `login` on `app`

The `webContents` property in the `login` event from `app` will be `null`
when the event is triggered for requests from the [utility process](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/utility-process)
created with `respondToAuthRequestsFromMainProcess` option.

#### Deprecated: `textured` option in `BrowserWindowConstructorOption.type`

The `textured` option of `type` in `BrowserWindowConstructorOptions` has been deprecated with no replacement. This option relied on the [`NSWindowStyleMaskTexturedBackground`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nswindowstylemask/nswindowstylemasktexturedbackground) style mask on macOS, which has been deprecated with no alternative.

#### Deprecated: `systemPreferences.accessibilityDisplayShouldReduceTransparency`

The `systemPreferences.accessibilityDisplayShouldReduceTransparency` property is now deprecated in favor of the new `nativeTheme.prefersReducedTransparency`, which provides identical information and works cross-platform.

```js
// Deprecated
const shouldReduceTransparency =
  systemPreferences.accessibilityDisplayShouldReduceTransparency;

// Replace with:
const prefersReducedTransparency = nativeTheme.prefersReducedTransparency;
```

## End of Support for 30.x.y

Electron 30.x.y has reached end-of-support as per the project's [support policy](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/electron-timelines#version-support-policy). Developers and applications are encouraged to upgrade to a newer version of Electron.

## What's Next

In the short term, you can expect the team to continue to focus on keeping up with the development of the major components that make up Electron, including Chromium, Node, and V8.
