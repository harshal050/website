## Notable Changes

## Highlights

- Implemented support for ECMAScript modules or ESM (What are ECMAScript modules? [learn more here](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#modules-ecmascript-modules). This includes support for ESM in Electron proper, as well as areas such as the `UtilityProcess` API entrypoints. [See our ESM documentation](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/esm) for more details.
- In addition to enabling ESM support in Electron itself, Electron Forge also supports using ESM to package, build and develop Electron applications. You can find this support in [Forge v7.0.0](https://github.com/electron/forge/releases/tag/v7.0.0) or higher.

### Breaking Changes

#### Behavior Changed: `WebContents.backgroundThrottling` set to false affects all `WebContents` in the host `BrowserWindow`

`WebContents.backgroundThrottling` set to false will disable frames throttling
in the `BrowserWindow` for all `WebContents` displayed by it.

#### Removed: `BrowserWindow.setTrafficLightPosition(position)`

`BrowserWindow.setTrafficLightPosition(position)` has been removed, the
`BrowserWindow.setWindowButtonPosition(position)` API should be used instead
which accepts `null` instead of `{ x: 0, y: 0 }` to reset the position to
system default.

```js
// Removed in Electron 28
win.setTrafficLightPosition({ x: 10, y: 10 });
win.setTrafficLightPosition({ x: 0, y: 0 });

// Replace with
win.setWindowButtonPosition({ x: 10, y: 10 });
win.setWindowButtonPosition(null);
```

#### Removed: `BrowserWindow.getTrafficLightPosition()`

`BrowserWindow.getTrafficLightPosition()` has been removed, the
`BrowserWindow.getWindowButtonPosition()` API should be used instead
which returns `null` instead of `{ x: 0, y: 0 }` when there is no custom
position.

```js
// Removed in Electron 28
const pos = win.getTrafficLightPosition();
if (pos.x === 0 && pos.y === 0) {
  // No custom position.
}

// Replace with
const ret = win.getWindowButtonPosition();
if (ret === null) {
  // No custom position.
}
```

#### Removed: `ipcRenderer.sendTo()`

The `ipcRenderer.sendTo()` API has been removed. It should be replaced by setting up a [`MessageChannel`](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/message-ports#setting-up-a-messagechannel-between-two-renderers) between the renderers.

The `senderId` and `senderIsMainFrame` properties of `IpcRendererEvent` have been removed as well.

#### Removed: `app.runningUnderRosettaTranslation`

The `app.runningUnderRosettaTranslation` property has been removed.
Use `app.runningUnderARM64Translation` instead.

```js
// Removed
console.log(app.runningUnderRosettaTranslation);
// Replace with
console.log(app.runningUnderARM64Translation);
```

## End of Support for 25.x.y

Electron 25.x.y has reached end-of-support as per the project's [support policy](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/electron-timelines#version-support-policy). Developers and applications are encouraged to upgrade to a newer version of Electron.

## What's Next

In the short term, you can expect the team to continue to focus on keeping up with the development of the major components that make up Electron, including Chromium, Node, and V8.
