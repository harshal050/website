### Highlighted Features

### UtilityProcess API [#36089](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/36089)

The new `UtilityProcess` main process module allows the creation of a lightweight Chromium child process with only Node.js integration while also allowing communication with a sandboxed renderer using `MessageChannel`. The API was designed based on Node.js `child_process.fork` to allow for easier transition, with one primary difference being that the entry point `modulePath` must be from within the packaged application to allow only for trusted scripts to be loaded. Additionally the module prevents establishing communication channels with renderers by default, upholding the contract in which the main process is the only trusted process in the application.

You can read more about the [new UtilityProcess API in our docs here](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/utility-process).

## Windows 7/8/8.1 Support Update

:::info

**2023/02/16: An update on Windows Server 2012 support**

Last month, Google announced that
[Chrome 109 would continue to receive critical security fixes](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/thread/185534987) for
Windows Server 2012 and Windows Server 2012 R2 until October 10, 2023.
In accordance, Electron 22's (Chromium 108) planned end of life date will be extended from May 30, 2023 to October 10, 2023. The Electron team will continue to backport any security fixes that are part of this program to Electron 22 until October 10, 2023.

Note that we will not make additional security fixes for Windows 7/8/8.1.
Also, Electron 23 (Chromium 110) will only function on Windows 10 and above as
previously announced.

:::

Electron 22 will be the last Electron major version to support Windows 7/8/8.1. Electron follows the planned Chromium deprecation policy, which will [deprecate Windows 7/8/8.1 support in Chromium 109 (read more here)](https://support.google.com/chrome/thread/185534985/sunsetting-support-for-windows-7-8-8-1-in-early-2023?hl=en).

Windows 7/8/8.1 will not be supported in Electron 23 and later major releases.

#### Additional Highlighted Changes

- Added support for Web Bluetooth pin pairing on Linux and Windows. [#35416](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/35416)
- Added `LoadBrowserProcessSpecificV8Snapshot` as a new fuse that will let the main/browser process load its v8 snapshot from a file at `browser_v8_context_snapshot.bin`. Any other process will use the same path as is used today. [#35266](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/35266)
- Added `WebContents.opener` to access window opener and `webContents.fromFrame(frame)` to get the WebContents corresponding to a WebFrameMain instance. [#35140](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/35140)
- Added support for `navigator.mediaDevices.getDisplayMedia` via a new session handler, `ses.setDisplayMediaRequestHandler`. [#30702](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/30702)

## Breaking API Changes

Below are breaking changes introduced in Electron 22. You can read more about these changes and future changes on the [Planned Breaking Changes](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/main/docs/breaking-changes.md) page.

#### Deprecated: `webContents.incrementCapturerCount(stayHidden, stayAwake)`

`webContents.incrementCapturerCount(stayHidden, stayAwake)` has been deprecated.
It is now automatically handled by `webContents.capturePage` when a page capture completes.

```diff
const w = new BrowserWindow({ show: false })

- w.webContents.incrementCapturerCount()
- w.capturePage().then(image => {
-   console.log(image.toDataURL())
-   w.webContents.decrementCapturerCount()
- })

+ w.capturePage().then(image => {
+   console.log(image.toDataURL())
+ })
```

#### Deprecated: `webContents.decrementCapturerCount(stayHidden, stayAwake)`

`webContents.decrementCapturerCount(stayHidden, stayAwake)` has been deprecated.
It is now automatically handled by `webContents.capturePage` when a page capture completes.

```diff
const w = new BrowserWindow({ show: false })

- w.webContents.incrementCapturerCount()
- w.capturePage().then(image => {
-   console.log(image.toDataURL())
-   w.webContents.decrementCapturerCount()
- })

+ w.capturePage().then(image => {
+   console.log(image.toDataURL())
+ })
```

#### Removed: WebContents `new-window` event

The `new-window` event of WebContents has been removed. It is replaced by [`webContents.setWindowOpenHandler()`](https://electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/web-contents#contentssetwindowopenhandlerhandler).

```diff
- webContents.on('new-window', (event) => {
-   event.preventDefault()
- })

+ webContents.setWindowOpenHandler((details) => {
+   return { action: 'deny' }
+ })
```

#### Deprecated: BrowserWindow `scroll-touch-*` events

The `scroll-touch-begin`, `scroll-touch-end` and `scroll-touch-edge` events on
BrowserWindow are deprecated. Instead, use the newly available
[`input-event` event](https://electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/web-contents#event-input-event) on WebContents.

```diff
// Deprecated
- win.on('scroll-touch-begin', scrollTouchBegin)
- win.on('scroll-touch-edge', scrollTouchEdge)
- win.on('scroll-touch-end', scrollTouchEnd)

// Replace with
+ win.webContents.on('input-event', (_, event) => {
+   if (event.type === 'gestureScrollBegin') {
+     scrollTouchBegin()
+   } else if (event.type === 'gestureScrollUpdate') {
+     scrollTouchEdge()
+   } else if (event.type === 'gestureScrollEnd') {
+     scrollTouchEnd()
+   }
+ })
```

## End of Support for 19.x.y

Electron 19.x.y has reached end-of-support as per the project's [support policy](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/electron-timelines#version-support-policy). Developers and applications are encouraged to upgrade to a newer version of Electron.

## What's Next

The Electron project will pause for the the month of December 2022, and return in January 2023. More information can be found in the [December shutdown blog post](https://www.electronjs.org/blog/a-quiet-place-22).

In the short term, you can expect the team to continue to focus on keeping up with the development of the major components that make up Electron, including Chromium, Node, and V8.
