## Notable Changes

### Highlights

- Added new API version history in our documentation, a feature created by @piotrpdev as part of Google Summer of Code. You can learn more about it in [this blog post](./introducing-api-history.md). [#42982](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/42982)
- Removed nonstandard File.path extension from the Web File API. [#42053](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/42053)

### Breaking Changes

#### Removed: `File.path`

The nonstandard `path` property of the Web [`File`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File) object was added in an early version of Electron as a convenience method for working with native files when doing everything in the renderer was more common. However, it represents a deviation from the standard and poses a minor security risk as well, so beginning in Electron 32.0 it has been removed in favor of the [`webUtils.getPathForFile`](https://github.com/electron/electron/tree/main/docs/api/web-utils.md#webutilsgetpathforfilefile) method.

```js
// Before (renderer)
const file = document.querySelector('input[type=file]');
alert(`Uploaded file path was: ${file.path}`);
```

```js
// After (renderer)
const file = document.querySelector('input[type=file]');
electron.showFilePath(file);

// After (preload)
const { contextBridge, webUtils } = require('electron');

contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld('electron', {
  showFilePath(file) {
    // It's best not to expose the full file path to the web content if
    // possible.
    const path = webUtils.getPathForFile(file);
    alert(`Uploaded file path was: ${path}`);
  },
});
```

#### Deprecated: `clearHistory`, `canGoBack`, `goBack`, `canGoForward`, `goForward`, `goToIndex`, `canGoToOffset`, `goToOffset` on `WebContents`

Navigation-related APIs on `WebContents` instances are now deprecated. These APIs have been moved to the `navigationHistory` property of `WebContents` to provide a more structured and intuitive interface for managing navigation history.

```js
// Deprecated
win.webContents.clearHistory();
win.webContents.canGoBack();
win.webContents.goBack();
win.webContents.canGoForward();
win.webContents.goForward();
win.webContents.goToIndex(index);
win.webContents.canGoToOffset();
win.webContents.goToOffset(index);

// Replace with
win.webContents.navigationHistory.clear();
win.webContents.navigationHistory.canGoBack();
win.webContents.navigationHistory.goBack();
win.webContents.navigationHistory.canGoForward();
win.webContents.navigationHistory.goForward();
win.webContents.navigationHistory.canGoToOffset();
win.webContents.navigationHistory.goToOffset(index);
```

## End of Support for 29.x.y

Electron 29.x.y has reached end-of-support as per the project's [support policy](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/electron-timelines#version-support-policy). Developers and applications are encouraged to upgrade to a newer version of Electron.
