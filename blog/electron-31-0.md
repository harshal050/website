### Breaking Changes

#### Removed: `WebSQL` support

Chromium has removed support for WebSQL upstream, transitioning it to Android only. See
[Chromium's intent to remove discussion](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/fWYb6evVA-w/m/pziWcvboAgAJ)
for more information.

#### Behavior Changed: `nativeImage.toDataURL` will preseve PNG colorspace

PNG decoder implementation has been changed to preserve colorspace data. The
encoded data returned from this function now matches it.

See [crbug.com/332584706](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/332584706) for more information.

#### Behavior Changed: `win.flashFrame(bool)` will flash dock icon continuously on macOS

This brings the behavior to parity with Windows and Linux. Prior behavior: The first `flashFrame(true)` bounces the dock icon only once (using the [NSInformationalRequest](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsrequestuserattentiontype/nsinformationalrequest) level) and `flashFrame(false)` does nothing. New behavior: Flash continuously until `flashFrame(false)` is called. This uses the [NSCriticalRequest](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsrequestuserattentiontype/nscriticalrequest) level instead. To explicitly use `NSInformationalRequest` to cause a single dock icon bounce, it is still possible to use [`dock.bounce('informational')`](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/dock#dockbouncetype-macos).

## End of Support for 28.x.y

Electron 28.x.y has reached end-of-support as per the project's [support policy](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/electron-timelines#version-support-policy). Developers and applications are encouraged to upgrade to a newer version of Electron.

## What's Next

In the short term, you can expect the team to continue to focus on keeping up with the development of the major components that make up Electron, including Chromium, Node, and V8.
