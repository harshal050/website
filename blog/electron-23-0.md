## Dropping Windows 7/8/8.1 Support

Electron 23 no longer supports Windows 7/8/8.1. Electron follows the planned Chromium deprecation policy, which will [deprecate Windows 7/8/8.1 , as well as Windows Server 2012 and 2012 R2 support in Chromium 109 (read more here)](https://support.google.com/chrome/thread/185534985/sunsetting-support-for-windows-7-8-8-1-in-early-2023?hl=en).

## Breaking API Changes

Below are breaking changes introduced in Electron 23. You can read more about these changes and future changes on the [Planned Breaking Changes](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/main/docs/breaking-changes.md) page.

### Removed: BrowserWindow `scroll-touch-*` events

The deprecated `scroll-touch-begin`, `scroll-touch-end` and `scroll-touch-edge` events on BrowserWindow have been removed. Instead, use the newly available `input-event` event on WebContents.

```diff
// Removed in Electron 23.0
-win.on('scroll-touch-begin', scrollTouchBegin)
-win.on('scroll-touch-edge', scrollTouchEdge)
-win.on('scroll-touch-end', scrollTouchEnd)

// Replace with
+win.webContents.on('input-event', (_, event) => {
+  if (event.type === 'gestureScrollBegin') {
+    scrollTouchBegin()
+  } else if (event.type === 'gestureScrollUpdate') +{
+    scrollTouchEdge()
+  } else if (event.type === 'gestureScrollEnd') {
+    scrollTouchEnd()
+  }
+})
```
