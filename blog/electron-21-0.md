## Breaking & API Changes

Below are breaking changes introduced in Electron 21.

### V8 Memory Cage Enabled

Electron 21 enables [V8 sandboxed pointers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HSap8-J3HcrZvT7-5NsbYWcjfc0BVoops5TDHZNsnko/edit), following Chrome's [decision to do the same in Chrome 103](https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/commit/9a6a76bf13d3ca1c6788de193afc5513919dd0ed). This has some implications for native modules. This feature has performance and security benefits, but also places some new restrictions on native modules, e.g. use of ArrayBuffers that point to external ("off-heap") memory. Please see [this blog post](https://electronjs.org/blog/v8-memory-cage) for more information. [#34724](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/34724)

### Refactored webContents.printToPDF

Refactored `webContents.printToPDF` to align with Chromium's headless implementation. See [#33654](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/33654) for more information.

More information about these and future changes can be found on the [Planned Breaking Changes](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/breaking-changes) page.

## End of Support for 18.x.y

Electron 18.x.y has reached end-of-support as per the project's [support policy](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/electron-timelines#version-support-policy). Developers and applications are encouraged to upgrade to a newer version of Electron.

## What's Next
