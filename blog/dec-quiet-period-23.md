## What will be the same in December

1. Zero-day and other major security-related releases will be published as necessary. Security
   incidents should be reported via [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/electron/electron/tree/main/SECURITY.md).
1. [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) reports
   and moderation will continue.

## What will be different in December

1. Electron 28.0.0 will be released on December 5th. After Electron 28, there will be no new Stable releases in December.
1. No Nightly and Alpha releases for the last two weeks of December.
1. With few exceptions, no pull request reviews or merges.
1. No issue tracker updates on any repositories.
1. No Discord debugging help from maintainers.
1. No social media content updates.

## Going forward

This is our third year running our quiet period experiment, and we've had a lot of success so far
in balancing a month of rest with maintaining our normal release cadence afterwards. Therefore,
we've decided to make this a regular part of our release calendar going forward. We'll still be
putting a reminder into the last stable release of every calendar year.

See you all in 2024!
