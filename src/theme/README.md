# Swizzled `src/theme` Components

The contents of this folder are custom Docusaurus React components generated
from the `yarn swizzle @docusaurus/theme-classic <component-name>` command.

Note that Docusaurus discourages the use of this command during the beta phase
due to API instability, so please keep swizzling to a minimum.

For more reading, see the [Themes](https://docusaurus.io/docs/using-themes)
guide in the Docusaurus documentation.

## List of Swizzled components

### `DocSidebarItem` (unsafe)

Electron has a lot of platform-specific APIs, and guides to go along with them.
A lot of these guides have long-winded suffixes indicating which platforms they
apply to (e.g. `(Windows and macOS)`). This information is more scannable with
visual imagery instead of text.

We can attach metadata onto `sidebars.js` items via the `customProps` object,
but the default `DocSidebarItem` component has no way to act on the props being
passed in, so we must Swizzle.

See: https://docusaurus.io/docs/sidebar#passing-custom-props

The `customProps` object will accept a `tags` property of type
`Array<'mac'|'windows'|'linux'>`. These will be rendered as SVG icons that are
stored as static assets in `static/assets/img/`.

```js
// sidebars.js
{
  type: 'doc',
  id: 'doc1',
  customProps: {
    tags: ['mac', 'windows', 'linux']
  },
};
```

### `TOC` (unsafe)

Electron's documentation uses a lot of Markdown syntax in its API documentation
headings to denote if an API has certain attributes (platform-specific, experimental,
deprecated, etc.). This clutters up heading titles.

We customize the right-hand side Table of Contents (TOC) component to run a script
(see `src/utils/cleanHeadings.js`) that cleans up the heading content before
it gets displayed on the website.
