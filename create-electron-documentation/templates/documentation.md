    Because Electron examples usually require multiple files (HTML, CSS, JS
    for the main and renderer process, etc.), we use this custom code block
    for Fiddle (https://www.electronjs.org/fiddle).
    Please modify any of the files in the referenced folder to fit your
    example.
    The content in this codeblock will not be rendered in the website so you
    can leave it empty.
