# Electron Internationalization

üåé üåç üåè

üíö **First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!** üíö

Anyone is welcome to join in the effort, regardless of technical experience or
familiarity with the Electron project.

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Electron's localization
effort. These are just guidelines, not rules, so use your best judgment and
feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Code of conduct

This project adheres to the Electron organization's [code of conduct][].
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable
behavior to coc@electronjs.org.

## Using Crowdin

Electron's localization effort uses [Crowdin][], an awesome platform for collaborative translation.
Translations made on Crowdin are periodically pulled into this repository, and changes made to the
source content is periodically uploaded to Crowdin.

### Translating

Here are some guidelines to keep in mind as a translator:

- Don't open pull requests to translate Electron; instead, do all translations on Crowdin.
- Do not translate JavaScript keywords like `String`, `Event`, `Array`, `Class`, etc.
- Do not translate Electron classes, method names, event names, etc.
- If you find an error in the source English docs, open a pull request on the
  [electron/electron][] repository, not on the website repository.

To get started, visit **[crowdin.com/project/electron][crowdin]** and log in with your GitHub account.

### Proofreading

On Crowdin, the **proofreader** role allows you to approve submitted translations.
If you would like to be promoted to proofreader status on the Electron project, please
please reach out in the #website-i18n channel in our [community Discord server][].

When contacting us, please include a link to your existing translations on the project (minimum
1000 words).

### Glossary

The Crowdin Glossary is **programatically generated**. It defines terms to give
translators context when translating in the Crowdin interface, and to help avoid
translations of strings like `Array` and `win.open()` that should remain in
their original "English" form. It includes entries for JavaScript builtins,
Electron API names, method names, event names, etc.
